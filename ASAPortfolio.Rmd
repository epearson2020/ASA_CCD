Dr. Pearson's Teaching Philosophy is: "I believe in teaching to help students construct knowledge. This entails making statements and asking directive and thought-shaping questions so students, through their answers and feedback, are able to construct what they know and learn. Students are best servest by an education that allows them to build upon what they know by anchoring their previous knowledge and experience to new information. Making these connections goes a long way in retaining what they have learned and then applying it to new and everyday situations. This also gives them a foundation and structure to be life-long learners."
